## Reactive Programming with RxJS

Hi there! My name is James. I’m happy to be here today to talk with you all about reactive programming with RxJS.

[Next slide]

## What is Reactive Programming?

Let’s start right off by asking "What is Reactive Programming?"

There are a lot of different definitions out there, some helpful, some less helpful.

Personally, I like how Andre Staltz defines it:

[Next slide]

_"Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams." -- The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing by Andre Staltz_

He goes on to say that this isn't really a new idea. And he's right. Mouse or keyboard events, for instance, are really just an asynchronous event stream that you can observe and use to perform side effects. Reactive programming takes the idea of streams and applies it to many different aspects of your application, including UI events, data flows, and other asynchronous operations such as HTTP calls.
