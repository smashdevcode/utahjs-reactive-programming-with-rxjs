## Reactive Programming with RxJS

Hi there! My name is James. I’m happy to be here today to talk with you all about reactive programming with RxJS.

[Next slide]

## What is Reactive Programming?

So let’s start right off by asking what is Reactive Programming?

There are a lot of different definitions out there, some helpful, some less helpful.

[Next slide]

Personally, I like how Andre Staltz defines it:

_"Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams." -- The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing by Andre Staltz_

He goes on to say that this isn't really a new idea. And he's right. Mouse or keyboard events, for instance, are really just an asynchronous event stream that you can observe and use to perform side effects. Reactive programming takes the idea of streams and applies it to many different aspects of your application, including UI events, data flows, and other asynchronous operations such as HTTP calls.

## Resources

### RxJS 5

When you’re searching for resources online, be sure that you’re looking at RxJS 5 resources. RxJS 4 is similar, but not the same.

### ReactiveX Website

The ReactiveX website has a lot of great content for learning about Rx.

### RxMarbles

RxMarbles is an interactive website for seeing visual representations of the various Rx operators.

### Reactive Programming with RxJS

Great book about RxJS. Uses RxJS 4 not 5.

### The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing

Great introduction to reactive programming using RxJS 4.

### Egghead.io

Egghead has video courses from Ben Lesh and Andre Staltz.

### Anything by Ben Lesh, Andre Staltz, and Rob Wormald

Really anything by Ben Lesh, Andre Staltz, and Rob Wormald
